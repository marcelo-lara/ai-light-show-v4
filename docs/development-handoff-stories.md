# Development Handoff Stories

Use these as small implementation handoff units. Each story should fit one focused PR or one focused LLM task.

## Handoff Spec

- Frontend dev port: `3400`.
- Backend API port: `3401`.
- Split work into backend, frontend, and validation tracks.
- Story ids stay stable even if list order changes.
- Prefer smaller stories over broad multi-surface stories.
- The server owns `current_song` and `current_canvas` state.
- The frontend should request song changes from the backend instead of loading songs directly.
- When a new song is loaded, the backend should return or push the updated current song and current canvas state to the frontend.
- If the current song has no canvas or show yet, the song should still load successfully; canvas creation happens only when the user triggers `Render`.
- The left control column uses tabs: one `Main` tab with `show name` and `Render`, then one tab per shader or layer property group.
